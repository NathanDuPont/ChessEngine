# ChessEngine
This repository contains the infrastructure and coding samples to create Chess-playing computer agent, trained using reinforcement learning using a user-defined reward function.

Within this repository, there includes source code to get your Agent running, along with associated documentation with information on how to use the included code.

**Documentation Website**: https://nathandupont.github.io/ChessEngine/

## Getting Started

To get this functioning locally, there are a few prerequisitves that you will need to have installed.

- Git
- Python (3.x.x)

Once these are met, installation of the repository can continue.

First, run the following command in the directory you wish to save the project folder to:

```
git@github.com:NathanDuPont/ChessEngine.git
```

From here, open up the project in an IDE such as *Visual Studio Code*. **For the following steps, it would be ideal to run them within a Python Virtual Environment, or venv**.

Open a terminal in the root directory of the project, and run the following commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure that all the dependencies for the documentation build are installed.

## Repository Documentation

The documentation site is built in Sphinx and can be accessed at https://nathandupont.github.io/ChessEngine/. Inside of here, you will find information on how to get started, as well as how to create your own agents and run them within the system.

Additional documentation can be found in the `README.md` files located in the `docs/` and `src/` directories, with specific instructions and information on the files located in the directories.
